<input> = search bar

1. block element - Takes up the whole line
2. inline block element - Only takes up what it needs to
3. in elements - text elements, appears in a line of text
Switching from block to inline block : display: ;

<div> = a box (a block element), can contain any other element inside
    meant to be containers. Allow us to group things together

Nested layout technique 

display: inline-block (has a problem with spacing and it is not vertically alligned)

grids maintain allignment

fr means freespace (takes up the remaining amount of space)
* it also 

flexbox acts more like a inline element

max width prevents the objects from being bigger than that
